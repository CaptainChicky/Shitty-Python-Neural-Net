# The color red basically is defined as follows
# Create an RGB color triple (r, g, b) and graph it on a 3D coordinate system with each axis being one of r, g, or b
# The color red is defined as any point that is within 127 units (inclusive) of the point (255, 0, 0) in this 3D coordinate system
# Basically its like part of a sphere with radius 127 centered at (255, 0, 0), and anything in this sphere is considered red

# Here is some more in depth explanation on what the output means: 
#   If we input a rbg value (r, b, g), we expect an output in the form (x, y) where x and y are between -1 and 1
#   The values are normalized between -1 and 1, so the absolute confidence that a color is red is (1, -1), and vice versa
#   We're basically looking for a difference of y - x = -2 when the color is red, and a difference of y - x = 2 when the color is not red
#   This is a wierd way to define red, because we can simply use one node in the neural net, but it is good practice to use two nodes as it is more generalizable
#   The reason we're not using values between 0 and 1 is because values between -1 and 1 have more flexibility and imo sigmoid just sucks as a function
